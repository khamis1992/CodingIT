The roadmap is based on a comprehensive competitive analysis and is designed to close critical feature gaps, differentiate the platform, and establish it as a leader in the AI coding space. The guiding strategy is to transform CodingIT into the **"Open-Source Agent-First Development Platform."**

---

## Phase 1: Close Critical Gaps (Month 1-2)

This phase focuses on implementing the most critical features that are now standard in the market. The goal is to achieve feature parity with leading competitors.

### 1.1. Agent Mode & Autonomous Task Completion

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want to provide a high-level task (e.g., "create a login page") and have an AI agent autonomously plan, code, test, and complete the task for me."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Agent State Machine**: Create a state machine to manage the agent's lifecycle (`PLANNING`, `CODING`, `TESTING`, `DEBUGGING`, `COMPLETED`). Store agent state in a new Supabase table (`agent_tasks`).
    - **Task Decomposition**: Use a powerful LLM (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to break down the user's prompt into a detailed implementation plan (a list of sub-tasks).
    - **E2B Integration**: The agent will interact with the E2B sandbox to read/write files, execute commands, and run tests.
    - **Iterative Development**: The agent will loop through the sub-tasks, generate code for each, test it in the sandbox, and use the test results (or errors) to self-correct and debug.
    - **UI**: Add a new "Agent Mode" tab to the UI. This will include a prompt input, a real-time log of the agent's actions, and a progress indicator for the sub-tasks.
- **Effort Estimate**: 15-20 days
- **Success Metrics**: 
    - 80% of simple tasks (e.g., creating a new component, adding an API route) are completed successfully without user intervention.
    - User satisfaction score of 4/5 for the Agent Mode feature.

### 1.2. Code Completion (Tab-to-Complete)

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want to receive intelligent code completion suggestions as I type in the editor, which I can accept by pressing the Tab key."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Monaco Editor Integration**: Modify the Monaco editor component to trigger a completion request on keystroke (with a 300ms debounce).
    - **AI Model Integration**: Use a fast code completion model like `Codestral` or the `fireworks/starcoder-7b` model. Send the current file content (up to the cursor position) as context.
    - **UI**: Display the AI-generated completion as a grayed-out suggestion in the editor. Handle the Tab key press to accept the suggestion.
- **Effort Estimate**: 3-5 days
- **Success Metrics**:
    - Code completion suggestions are provided in under 500ms.
    - At least 30% of suggestions are accepted by users.

### 1.3. One-Click Deployment

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want to deploy my application to a public URL with a single click, directly from the CodingIT interface."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Vercel API Integration**: Use the Vercel API to trigger deployments. Users will need to connect their Vercel account via OAuth.
    - **File Sync**: Create a mechanism to sync the current state of the E2B sandbox file system to a temporary location.
    - **Deployment Process**: When the user clicks "Deploy", package the files and use the Vercel API to create a new deployment. The deployment URL will be displayed in the UI.
    - **UI**: Add a "Deploy" button to the main toolbar. Show deployment status (in progress, success, failed) and the final URL.
- **Effort Estimate**: 5-7 days
- **Success Metrics**:
    - Users can successfully deploy a simple Next.js app in under 2 minutes.
    - 95% deployment success rate.

### 1.4. Codebase Search (Semantic Search)

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want to search my entire codebase using natural language to find the most relevant files and code snippets."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Vector Database**: Use the `pgvector` extension on Supabase to store code embeddings.
    - **Embedding Generation**: When a user imports a repository, create a background job that reads all files, splits them into chunks, generates embeddings using `text-embedding-3-small`, and stores them in a new `code_embeddings` table.
    - **Search API**: Create a new API route that takes a natural language query, generates an embedding for it, and performs a similarity search against the `code_embeddings` table.
    - **UI**: Add a new search bar to the file tree. Display search results with file names and relevant code snippets.
- **Effort Estimate**: 7-10 days
- **Success Metrics**:
    - Search results for common queries are returned in under 2 seconds.
    - Top 3 search results are relevant for 80% of queries.

## Phase 2: Differentiate (Month 3-4)

This phase focuses on building unique features that leverage CodingIT's strengths (open-source, multi-environment) to create a competitive advantage.

### 2.1. Multi-Environment Agents

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want to use specialized agents that are experts in the specific environment I'm working in (e.g., a 'Data Science Agent' for Python, a 'Full-Stack Agent' for Next.js)."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Agent Specialization**: Create different system prompts and toolsets for agents based on the selected environment.
    - **Python Agent**: Give the agent access to data analysis libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) and the ability to generate and display plots.
    - **Next.js Agent**: Train the agent on Next.js best practices, including Server Actions, App Router, and Vercel deployment.
    - **Vue/Streamlit/Gradio Agents**: Create specialized prompts and examples for each of these frameworks.
    - **UI**: Allow the user to select an agent specialty when starting a new agent task.
- **Effort Estimate**: 10-15 days
- **Success Metrics**:
    - Specialized agents outperform the general agent on environment-specific tasks by 30% (measured by task completion rate and user satisfaction).

### 2.2. Real-Time Collaboration

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want to invite my team members to my workspace and code together in real-time, like in Google Docs."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **CRDTs**: Use `Y.js` to handle conflict-free replicated data types for the editor content.
    - **WebSocket Provider**: Use `supabase-js` Realtime channels to broadcast changes to all connected clients. This avoids the need for a separate WebSocket server.
    - **Presence**: Implement presence indicators to show who is currently in the workspace and what file they are editing.
    - **UI**: Add a "Share" button to invite users. Display avatars of collaborators in the header.
- **Effort Estimate**: 20-25 days
- **Success Metrics**:
    - Latency for real-time updates is under 200ms.
    - No data loss or conflicts during collaborative sessions.

### 2.3. Open-Source Agent Marketplace

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want to browse and use agents created by the community, or create and share my own agents."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Agent Definition**: Create a JSON schema for defining an agent (system prompt, tools, model preferences).
    - **Community Repo**: Create a public GitHub repository where users can submit their agent definitions as JSON files.
    - **Agent Registry**: Build a service that pulls agent definitions from the GitHub repo and makes them available in the CodingIT UI.
    - **UI**: Create a new "Marketplace" tab where users can browse, search, and select community-created agents.
- **Effort Estimate**: 10-15 days
- **Success Metrics**:
    - 10+ community-created agents are available in the marketplace within the first month.
    - 20% of agent tasks are performed using community agents.

## Phase 3: Dominate (Month 5-6)

This phase focuses on building advanced features that will establish CodingIT as a market leader and a thought leader in the AI coding space.

### 3.1. Spec-Driven Development & Auto-Documentation

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want the AI agent to first generate a detailed technical specification and architecture diagram for my approval, and then automatically generate documentation (a 'Repo Wiki') as it builds the application."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Spec Generation**: Add a `SPEC_GENERATION` step to the agent state machine. The agent will analyze the prompt and generate a markdown document with the proposed architecture, data models, and implementation plan.
    - **User Approval**: The agent will pause and wait for the user to approve or request changes to the spec before proceeding to the `CODING` step.
    - **Repo Wiki**: As the agent builds the application, it will continuously update a `README.md` and other documentation files in the repository, explaining the code it has written. This can be built on top of the codebase search embeddings.
    - **UI**: Display the generated spec for user review. Create a "Wiki" tab to display the auto-generated documentation.
- **Effort Estimate**: 15-20 days
- **Success Metrics**:
    - 70% of users engage with the spec generation step (approve or request changes).
    - The auto-generated documentation is rated as "helpful" by 80% of users.

### 3.2. Advanced Memory & Learning

- **User Story**: "As a user, I want the AI to remember my coding style, preferences, and past interactions, so it gets smarter and more personalized over time."
- **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Interaction History**: Store all user prompts and AI responses in a Supabase table.
    - **Preference Extraction**: Create a background job that periodically analyzes the interaction history to extract user preferences (e.g., preferred libraries, coding patterns, naming conventions).
    - **Dynamic Prompts**: Inject the extracted preferences into the system prompt for all future interactions.
    - **UI**: Add a "Preferences" page where users can view and edit the AI's learned preferences.
- **Effort Estimate**: 10-15 days
- **Success Metrics**:
    - The AI's suggestions and generated code become more aligned with the user's style over time (measured by a reduction in manual edits).
