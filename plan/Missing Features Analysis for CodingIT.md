## Executive Summary

After analyzing the uploaded documents (which appear to be for a bolt.diy-based system with Kosuke-Core, AutoBE, and Devika integrations), I've identified **27 critical features** that are missing from the original CodingIT enhancement plan. These features fall into 6 major categories and represent significant competitive opportunities.

---

## Category 1: Error Prevention & Recovery (CRITICAL)

### 1. Deterministic Code Fixer ⭐⭐⭐

**What It Is**: AST-based error fixing that doesn't rely on LLM prompting for common TypeScript errors.

**Why CodingIT Needs It**:
- Prevents infinite error loops (user pain point #1)
- Fixes errors instantly without token cost
- Validates fixes before applying
- Tracks fix history to prevent loops

**Implementation Complexity**: HIGH  
**User Impact**: CRITICAL - Solves #1 user complaint  
**Competitive Advantage**: Only Qoder has similar capability

**Technical Approach**:
```typescript
// Deterministic fixes for common TS errors
- TS2307: Module not found → Create missing file
- TS2305: Missing export → Add export statement
- TS2304: Undefined name → Add declaration
- TS2724: Incorrect import → Fix import path
```

---

### 2. Error Loop Detection System ⭐⭐⭐

**What It Is**: Monitors error patterns and stops after 3 failed fix attempts.

**Why CodingIT Needs It**:
- Prevents token drain on repetitive fixes
- Escalates to human when stuck
- Saves user money and frustration

**Implementation Complexity**: MEDIUM  
**User Impact**: CRITICAL  
**Competitive Advantage**: No competitor has this

---

### 3. Fix Validation System ⭐⭐⭐
